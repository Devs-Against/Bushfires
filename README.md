# Devs Against Bushfires

Welcome to the Devs against bushfires repo. This repo is intended to brainstorm and document ideas and paint points related to the challenges that bushfires bring.

To create an idea or a paint point submit an issue and label it accordingly. When submitting an idea if it relates to a paint point please link the issue.

Looking forward to seeing your contributions


To create a new repo for an idea please contact one of the admins and we will include you in the organisation.

If you wish to create a repo thatâ€™s not apart of Devs against Bushfires we can still link to it under open repos but we can not extend funding/donations for hosting
